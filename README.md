## About me
I am a Director at Liberty Mutual Insurance focusing on Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), where my responsibilities involve contributing and guiding teams to develop state-of-the-art solutions applicable across for the enterprise. 

Previously, I was a senior research scientist at Philips Research North America, where I focused on designing and implementing NLP algorithms for problems related to clinical domain. 

I received my PhD in Computer Science from University of Maryland, Baltimore County. My PhD dissertation focused on developing ML and NLP algorithms to improve the quality of knowledge graphs. I was advised by Prof. [Tim Finin](https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/~finin/) and Prof. [Francis Ferraro](https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/~ferraro/).

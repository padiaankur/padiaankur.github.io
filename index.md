## About me

I am a Director at Liberty Mutual Insurance, focusing on Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). My responsibilities involve contributing to and guiding teams in the development of state-of-the-art solutions.

Previously, I worked as a senior research scientist at Philips Research North America, where I concentrated on designing and implementing NLP algorithms for problems related to the clinical domain.

I earned my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. My PhD dissertation was centered around developing ML and NLP algorithms to enhance the quality of knowledge graphs. I was under the guidance of Prof. [Tim Finin](https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/~finin/) and Prof. [Francis Ferraro](https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/~ferraro/).
